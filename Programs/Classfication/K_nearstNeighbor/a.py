# K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm. Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding
# to their classification. To predict the class of a given data point, it takes into account the classes of the 'K'
# nearest data points
# and chooses the class in which the majority of the 'K' nearest data points belong to as the predicted class.
