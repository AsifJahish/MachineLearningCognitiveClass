# Non-linear regression is a method to model the non-linear relationship between the independent variables  洧논
#   and the dependent variable  洧녽
#  . Essentially any relationship that is not linear can be termed as non-linear,
#  and is usually represented by the polynomial of  洧녲
#   degrees (maximum power of  洧논
#  ). For example:
#
#  洧녽=洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬
#
# Non-linear functions can have elements like exponentials, logarithms, fractions, and so on. For example:
# 洧녽=log(洧논)
#
# We can have a function that's even more complicated such as :
# 洧녽=log(洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬)
