# Logarithmic
# The response  洧녽
#   is a results of applying the logarithmic map from the input  洧논
#   to the output  洧녽
#  . It is one of the simplest form of log(): i.e.
# 洧녽=log(洧논)
#
# Please consider that instead of  洧논
#  , we can use  洧녦
#  , which can be a polynomial representation of the  洧논
#   values. In general form it would be written as
# 洧녽=log(洧녦)
